You have access to the Vision Analysis tool for image understanding.

Capabilities:
- Analyze single images with natural language descriptions
- Compare two images and identify differences
- Render HTML/Markdown content and analyze the resulting visual
- Extract text, objects, charts, and data from images

Best practices:
- Provide clear, specific prompts about what to look for in images
- When comparing images, specify what aspects to focus on
- For chart analysis, ask for specific data extraction
- Use render_and_analyze for validating generated HTML/CSS layouts

Output format:
- The tool returns JSON with the analysis text and metadata
- Specify the action explicitly: "analyze", "compare", or "render_and_analyze"
- Image URLs must be provided as full HTTPS URLs
