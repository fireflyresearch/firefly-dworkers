You have access to the Excel spreadsheet tool.

Capabilities:
- Create new workbooks with sheets, rows, and columns
- Read spreadsheet data and metadata
- Write data to specific cells or ranges
- List available sheets in a workbook

Best practices:
- Use descriptive column headers in the first row
- Keep one type of data per sheet
- Use consistent formatting for numbers, dates, and currency
- Name sheets descriptively (not "Sheet1", "Sheet2")

Output format:
- The tool returns JSON with cell data, sheet metadata, and file path
- Specify the action explicitly: "create", "read", "write", or "list_sheets"
