You have access to the Word document tool.

Capabilities:
- Create new documents with headings, paragraphs, and formatted text
- Read document content and metadata
- Add sections, tables, and bullet lists to existing documents
- Export document structure

Best practices:
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single topic
- Use bullet points for lists of 3 or more items
- Include an executive summary for documents longer than 2 pages

Output format:
- The tool returns JSON with document content, metadata, and file path
- Specify the action explicitly: "create", "read", "add_section", or "add_table"
